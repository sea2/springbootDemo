        subscription basis (&laquo;Subscription(s)&raquo;). Subscription provides access to dynamic content or services
        in the Game on an ongoing basis. Subscriptions may be available at different fees chargeable for a set period of
        time specified in the Game (&laquo;Subscription Period&raquo;). Payments for such subscriptions would&nbsp;be
        charged&nbsp;at your Apple App Store or Google Play account (&laquo;Account&raquo;) when You confirm the
        Subscription by available confirmation tools of the Game. You acknowledge and agree that all billing and
        transaction processes are handled by App Store or Google Play, from which platform You downloaded the App, and
        are governed by their terms and conditions. If You have any payment related issues, then You need to contact App
        Store or Google Play directly.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;white-space:pre-wrap;">2. Trial Subscription is offered free of
        charge for certain period of time from activation specified in the relevant offer in the Game. If You do not
        cancel the Trial Subscription within such period, Subscription Fee shall be withdrawn from Your Account when the
        trial period expires. Please note that Your Subscription begins immediately after the activation of a trial
        Subscription, not after the Three-day trial period.&nbsp;You may cancel a subscription during its free trial
        period using the Subscription setting of Your Account. This must&nbsp;be done&nbsp;24 hours before the end of
        the free trial subscription period (Apple App Store), or at any time before the end of the free trial
        subscription period (Google Play Store), otherwise it will be renewed as a paid subscription. LINKING cannot
        cancel Your free-trial subscription if it has already been activated.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;white-space:pre-wrap;">3. Subscription is automatically&nbsp;renewable
        for the same price and duration period as the original subscription package chosen by You, unless You turn off
        it: in case of an Apple App Store, at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period, or (ii)
        in case of Google Play Store, at any time before the end of the subscription period. Subscription Fee for
        renewal shall be taken from Your Account within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period
        (Apple App Store), or at the end of the subscription period (Google Play Store) at the cost of the chosen
        package. In case Subscription Fee cannot be taken from Your Account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity
        of credit card or for any other reasons, Your Subscription is automatically cancelled.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;white-space:pre-wrap;">4. Once You have bought a Subscription, You
        can manage it and switch off automatic renewal at any time after the purchase in Your Account setting. If
        Subscription has already been activated, You can cancel the Subscription at any time and the cancellation will
        take effect after the end of the last day of that subscription period.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;white-space:pre-wrap;">5. Except when required by law, paid
        Subscription Fees are non-refundable.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;white-space:pre-wrap;">6. LINKING in its sole discretion and at any
        time may modify the Subscription Fee. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the
        current Subscription period. You will be provided a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription Fee.
        If You do not take action to agree to the increase in Subscription Fee, Your Subscription shall expire at the
        end of the current Subscription period.</p>
